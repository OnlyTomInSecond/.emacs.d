# .emacs.d
Tom's emacs configuration, ~~copied from everywhere~~

## Requirements
Emacs version >= 29.0, or with `use-package` preinstalled.

## How to use
- 1. Backup your emacs configuration, clone this repo to your emacs confinguration directory (usually in ~/.emacs.d/ )
- 2. Install lsp servers for your own programming language.
  - `ccls` / `clangd` for C/C++ (In my configuration, I only configured `ccls`)
- 3. Start your emacs, and enjoy!

## Shortcuts
Most shortcuts are from emacs it self, only defined new shortcuts for new functions.

winner-mode:
shift+up, down, left, right: move cursor between window buffers.
